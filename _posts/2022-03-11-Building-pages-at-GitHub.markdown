Well, the test server, where we were testing Docker for Windows, decided to give up. Luckily we had backup of content in Jekyll markdown format. Idea is not to dedicate yet new machine to Jekyll, but to build online .. while testing GitHub Pages

### Counting blessings 

1. No need for maintenance of server / service
2. Learning new things
3. To be announced

Lets see where this new approach takes us.

> Such time to be alive

If it goes well, we will forward solution to a partner .. more soon
