For the purpose of having a rich site on the cheap, we have looked into "static site generators" and have ended up adopting Jekyll. What it amounts to for you, as a user, is that you do not have to have expensive and delicate database backed website, but move the generation of pages back home. How many benefits can you think of? There is intro appetizer to Jekyll technology bellow ..

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
