For the sake of saving money and trying something new, we decided to give a go to a Docker based Jekyll application. How would it turn out, is it to show itself user friendly or are we to hate it soon?

### Counting blessings 

1. No need for database and server side mumbo jumbo
2. Cheap or free hosting in place of virtual server or pricey hosting solutins
3. To be announced

Of curse, we have already started noticing 'bad' things too. Like need to learn AND remember markup. Is there a training session needed to que the new guy into this? ..

Yes, yes, people, its all very fun indeed and we are looking forward to do more of this thing. We are not selling it so you can trust us ;)
